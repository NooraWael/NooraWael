# 👋 Hey, I’m Noora

## 🚀 Mobile Developer | 🎤 Public Speaker | 🧩 Problem Solver (and Occasional Chaos Bringer)



I build things that make people go “wait… that actually works?”
Fueled by curiosity, caffeine, and a love for solving puzzles — whether it’s a tricky bug, a messy idea, or a wild hackathon prompt.

### My passion? Creating impact through code and conversation.

🧠 What I’m About

📱 Crafting experiences for mobile — mostly with React Native (and sometimes Swift).

🪄 Turning random ideas into fun little projects that maybe shouldn’t exist (but do anyway).

🎤 Teaching others to speak up because tech isn’t just about code, it’s about communication.

🔍 Addicted to problem-solving and debugging brain teasers for no reason at all.
